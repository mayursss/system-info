# System-info App
- This app is build in electron as per blog from Michael Willis
- Link Michael Willis's [powershell-electron-demo](https://xainey.github.io/2017/powershell-electron-demo/)
- I have added few more buttons to query system info linke Disk, Process info and user info and kept it for local use only and not for powershell remoting.
